This is a real estate price prediction model. The above image shows the webpage of the website used for predicting the price. 
In this project, I have used bangalore house dataset which is available on Kaggle. During model building, I have used data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
The model has used features such as total sq.ft area, number of rooms and location of the house as input and predicting the price as output.
Uses Linear Regression model for prediction of the price of the house.
Technology and tools used in this project are,

1.Python
2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.Matplotlib for data visualization
4.Sklearn for model building
5.Jupyter notebook as IDE
6.Python flask for http server
7.HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
