This is a real estate price prediction model. The above image shows the webpage where we can use the data science model easily. 
In this project, I have used bangalore house dataset which is available on Kaggle. During model building, I have used data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
Technology and tools used in this project are,

1.Python
2.Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.Matplotlib for data visualization
4.Sklearn for model building
5.Jupyter notebook as IDE
6.Python flask for http server
7.HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
